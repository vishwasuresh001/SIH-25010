## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a *Smart Crop Advisory System* that helps farmers make better decisions using digital tools.  
It brings together crop advisory, soil and weather analysis, pest detection, and market insights into one platform.

- Provides *personalized crop guidance* using soil data and weather updates.  
- Helps address common issues faced by farmers such as unpredictable weather, pest attacks, and unstable market prices.

## Technical Approach
The system uses a modular design with different services connected through an API Gateway.

- *Technologies*  
  - Backend: Python (Django/Flask)  
  - Frontend: JavaScript (React)  
  

- *Methodology*  
  1. Farmers use the *mobile app or USSD service* to raise queries.  
  2. Requests go through an *API Gateway* for routing and authentication.  
  3. The request is sent to the right *backend service* (crop advisory, pest detection, weather/soil, market monitoring).  


## Feasibility and Viability

### Feasibility
The system is practical because it makes use of technologies that are already common in agriculture, such as weather APIs, mobile apps, and cloud storage.  
It does not demand high-end infrastructure and can be expanded gradually as more farmers adopt it.

---

### Challenges
- Limited digital literacy among small-scale farmers.  
- Data accuracy issues when integrating soil and pest datasets.  

---

### Solutions
- Training sessions and awareness campaigns to help farmers become familiar with the app and USSD services.  
- Building partnerships with local agricultural officers to ensure reliable data collection.  
- Updating AI models regularly with field data provided by agricultural universities.

## Impact and Benefits

### Impact on Farmers
Farmers receive precise recommendations on when to sow, irrigate, and harvest, helping them avoid losses due to guesswork.  

### Social Benefits
Encourages rural communities to adopt digital tools, creating awareness and reducing their dependency on traditional word-of-mouth advice.
